  <p>
    By opting in, you consent to receive occasional test messages. 
    Message frequency is expected to be very low (typically under 30 per month). 
    Message and data rates may apply depending on your mobile carrier.

    Participation is voluntary. You may opt out at any time by contacting me. 
    Once you opt out, no further messages will be sent.
