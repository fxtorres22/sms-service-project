  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Effective date: November 4, 2025</p>

  <p><strong>Program:</strong> “SMS Service Project” (personal, educational, non-commercial).</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Controller / Owner (business name for messaging):</strong> Fernando Torres (individual)<br>
    <strong>Location:</strong> Ohio, United States<br>
    <strong>Contact email:</strong> <a href="mailto:contact@sms-service-project.org">contact@sms-service-project.org</a>
  </p>

  <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Mobile phone number (required) and optional name/email submitted during opt-in; opt-out requests and related logs.</li>
    <li>Basic technical logs from form submissions (e.g., timestamp, user agent, IP address) to maintain records of consent and system security.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Purpose &amp; Legal Basis</h2>
  <p>
    The SMS Service Project is a personal learning project. Data is used to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Send occasional test SMS messages related to apps and prototypes being developed.</li>
    <li>Maintain records of consent, opt-outs, and delivery results for compliance and troubleshooting.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Messages are only sent to numbers that have provided opt-in, and you can opt out at any time.
  </p>

  <h2>Use &amp; Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    No mobile information will be shared with third parties/affiliates for marketing/promotional purposes.
    All the above categories exclude text messaging originator opt-in data and consent; this information will not be shared with any third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We keep data for as long as reasonably needed for testing and compliance or until you ask us to delete it.
    Opt-out requests and related records may be kept in a suppression log so we can continue honoring your opt-out in the future.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Choices &amp; Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Reply <code>STOP</code> to any message to opt out at any time.</li>
    <li>Email <a href="mailto:contact@sms-service-project.org">contact@sms-service-project.org</a> for help or questions.</li>
    <li>
      You may email us to request access to, correction of, or deletion of the personal data stored for this project.
      We will respond within a reasonable time, subject to any legal or technical limits (for example, records needed to honor prior opt-outs).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    We apply reasonable administrative and technical safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the data,
    including role-limited access, encrypted transport (HTTPS), and secure hosting with reputable providers.
    No system can be guaranteed 100% secure, but we aim to protect data from accidental loss, misuse, or unauthorized access.
  </p>

  <h2>International Considerations</h2>
  <p>
    This project is operated from the United States. SMS routing and cloud hosting may involve processing data in other regions
    depending on the infrastructure of our service providers.
  </p>
